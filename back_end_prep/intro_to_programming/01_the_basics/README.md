### Difference between single and double quotes

Escaping characters
```ruby
# Ex. 1: with double quotes
"The man said, 'Hi there!'"

# Ex 2: with single quotes and escaping
'The man said, \'Hi there!\''
```
String interpolation with double quotes
```ruby
irb :001 > a = 'ten'
=> "ten"

irb :002 > "My favorite number is #{a}!"
=> "My favorite number is ten!"
```
