# Preparation

## Methods
In documentation, methods are either denoted by a ```::``` or a ```#```
* ```::``` denotes a class method
* ```::``` denotes an instance method

**NOTE:** these symbols have different meanings in code syntax (vs. documentation syntax)

* Instance methods: can be applied to any instance of the class (Ex.
```ruby
"world wide web".split
```
)
* Class methods: are called directly from the class (Ex.
```ruby
String.new("blue")
```
)
