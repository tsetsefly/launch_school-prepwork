## Question 1: Greeting Through Methods (Part 1)

**Q:** Write two methods, one that returns the string "Hello" and one that returns the string "World". Then print both strings using #puts, combining them into one sentence.

```
Hello World
```

**A:**

```ruby
def hello
	return "Hello"
end

def world
	return "World"
end

puts "#{hello} #{world}"
```

To do anything with the methods, we first have to define them. We've chosen to define our methods as hello and world. We've written both methods to only do one thing: return a string. This makes it easy for us to print the desired strings simply by calling the methods with #puts.
