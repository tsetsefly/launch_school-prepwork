## Question 1: Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 1)

```ruby

  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal
```

**A:**

```Breakfast```

Determining the return value of a method can sometimes be confusing. If there's no return then how do I know what the return value is? That's a valid question with a simple answer: every method returns the evaluated result of the last line that is executed. In other words, every method returns the return value of the last line in the method.

The only way to ensure a specific return value, other than putting it as the last line, is to use return. When return is executed, it immediately exits the method, returning the provided value.
