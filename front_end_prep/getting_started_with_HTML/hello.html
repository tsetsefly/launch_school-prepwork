ELEMENTS
strong = Visibly changes the wrapped text to be bold. Text will have a stronger importance than the surrounding text.
em = Visibly changes the wrapped text to be italicized. Demonstrates what part of the sentence is to receive emphasis.
b = Visibly changes the wrapped text to be bold. Does not affect the meaning of the content as the strong element does.
i = Visibly changes the wrapped text to be italicized. Does not affect the meaning of the content as the em element does.
sub = Adjusts the position of the text to be lower than the text around it. Short for subscript. Example: Carbon dioxide has a chemical formula of CO2.
sup = Adjusts the position of the text to be higher than the text around it. Short for superscript. Example: Multiply your result by 10^3.

HTML Containers = div + span elements... don't convey additional meaning
div = block elements by default
span = inline
